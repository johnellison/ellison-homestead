title: Open House Spring 2017
description: This spring we'll be holding an open house to welcome the local community
  into our homestead to celebrate the start of a new growing season and a new family
  in the area. There will be a free barbeque with plenty to go around. If you're planning
  on coming, please bring some drinks and sides to share.
