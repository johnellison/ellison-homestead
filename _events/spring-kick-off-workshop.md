title: Spring Kick-Off Workshop
description: If you're interested in living on the land in community with others,
  please feel free to attend our spring kick-off workshop. We'll be hosting a local
  charity called New Routes that provides integration support for asylum seekers in
  Norwich. Following in the tradition of The Grange, we'll have a weekly volunteer
  day every Wednesday throughout 2017.
