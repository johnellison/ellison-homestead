My mother Sarah taught me how to walk, play soccer and ski. Once able-bodied, she became dependent on walking aids and eventually a wheelchair. After trying dozens of treatments, we discovered [The Wahls Protocol](http://terrywahls.com/about-the-wahls-protocol/): A clinically-tested approach to treating MS and other autoimmune diseases. The outcome of this protocol changed our family's life forever.

## My Mother's Experience with The Wahls Protocol
A very good friend discovered [Terry Wahls's Ted Talk] online and said that we had to watch the video. We were a bit skeptical at first. Throughout my life I've seen well-intentioned people get excited about something they heard on the radio or watched on TV that could help my mom with MS. They would talk about how [bee stings](#) could help, and how we should check out the medicine that has been developed in the UK but is still undergoing FDA studies, etc.

### Yet another complementary approach to MS?
Every time someone offers a complementary treatment for MS to my mom I could feel the apprehension rising, remembering the emotional highs and lows of looking into and experimenting with alternative therapies.

### Functional Medicine
But after watching Dr. Terry Wahls's Ted Talk, there seemed to be some real potential. Dr. Wahls was talking about her own personal journey with MS and how she discovered Functional Medicine, the same discipline that brought my wife out of a downward spiral of chronic illness. We'd witnessed the effects of Functional Medicine to address autoimmune disorder firsthand, and had spoken to other patients who experienced similar recoveries. When conventional doctors had failed us time and time again, Functional Medicine kicked in.

(I go more into Functional Medicine in detail over here, if you're interested.)

We bought Dr. Wahls's book and read it cover to cover. There were several other friends and family members within the community who heard of Terry Wahls's story and wanted to know if they could help. These friends were always looking for ways to support my mom and our family, but as you can probably relate, often times there's not much that can be done to help someone who is suffering from an autoimmune condition.

## The Power of Community
My wife Sophie and I read through the entire book and created a short 10-page summary describing The Wahls Protocol, including meal plans and a possible rotor schedule. We met with the five or six friends and family members who were interested in cooking meals and discussed a plan.

Over the next four months, we provided my mother with two meals a day according to The Wahls Protocol. We created shopping lists, collected recipes and shared tips and tricks. It was really hard work. It took an incredible amount of time to cook just four meals in a week.

The benefit for us was that we were already cooking similar meals for my wife, although The Wahls Protocol did have specific quirks like vegetable smoothies with 6-9 cups of veg per day...

## The First Three Months
It was a really tough emotional experience for us all. My mom was hopeful, but also a bit overwhelmed. There was a lot of new information and a completely new way to eat. Food has tight internal ties for a lot of people and my mother is no different.

In the first three months, my mom experienced a lot of detox symptoms, something that Dr. Wahls describes herself:

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehender.

But somewhere after the 90-day mark, my mom started to notice some specific recovery symptoms:

- Remembering incidents in her past
- Having more energy throughout the day
- Feeling less exhausted after an outing
- Not needing naps throughout the day

## After 18 Months
Now after 18-months on the diet-side of the protocol...
